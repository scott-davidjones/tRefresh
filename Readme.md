# tRefresh 

## About
tRefresh was born from a frustration of the current Expression Engine (EE) 2.x template, snippets and global variables system. I found the constant backwards and forwards between the template manager and the actual tamplate I was editing to be time consuming and less productive.

Thus this module was envisioned. It will heavilly depend on JavaScript to pull and save templates, snippets, global variables, template preferences, global template preferences and eventually it will also allow for the export and import of snippets, templates, globals and low variables.

I will also be implementing an [ACE Editor](http://ace.ajax.org/ "ACE Editor") for syntax highlighting.

    NB: this module will nto be using jQuery. The size of this project does not really necessitate the need for such a large lib.
